description: "On a a dead-simple and beautiful Hugo theme."
---

While procrastinating on writing my master’s thesis, I started experimenting with agentic coding in VSCode. Since I’d been meaning to create a new Hugo theme for a personal blog anyway, I gave the agent a rough idea of what I wanted and let it run. Several dopamine-filled feedback loops later, I ended up with something I’m actually pretty happy with. The theme does the bare minimum, which is exactly why I love it.

For those interested, here is what a full-paged version of the blog would look like. Hopefully it won't take me _too_ long to get there :p
